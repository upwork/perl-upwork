    https://developers.upwork.com/api-tos.html

# Application Integration
To integrate this library you need to have:

* Perl >= 5.008003
* CPAN

## Example
In addition to this, a full example is available in the `example` directory. 
This includes `myapp.pl` that gets an access token and requests the data
for applications that are not web-based applications.

## Installation
1.
Start `cpan`

2.
Run the following command to install API:
```
cpan> install Net::Upwork::API // make sure to install the latest 1.xx version in order to work with OAuth1, version 2.xx is aimed to work with OAuth2
```

3.
open `myapp.pl` and type the consumerKey and consumerSecret that you previously got from the API Center.
***That's all. Run your app as `perl myapp.pl` and have fun.***
